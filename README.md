# Rock Papers Scissors
is a hand game originating from China, usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

## Computer version
In my version the rules are as above but you play vs computer.

Computer picking randomly one of three options and when user input his option, the output let you know who won. 

At the end of game the scores are calculeted and printed.

Good Luck!
